==============

It is a little framework to deal with web-crawlers. It is aimed for stock market crawlers.

I belive that it will be made of 3 main modules:

- robots:
    This will handle all the crawlers-sub-modules

- psychics:
    This will use the data that the crawlers gathered.
	Then it will guess something, some number, some date.
        Very deep magic here.

- 'i havent named it yet' ('benchmark')
    It evals the guesses end measures the error.
	Maybe it will plot beautiful graphs.
