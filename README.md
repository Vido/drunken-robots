==============

It's a little framework to deal with web-crawlers. It's aimed for stock market crawlers.

I believe that it will be made of 4 main modules:

- robots:
    This will handle all the crawlers-sub-modules

- psychics:
    This will use the data that the crawlers gathered.
	Then it will guess something, some number, some date.
        Very deep magic here.

- 'i havent named it yet' ('benchmark')
    It evals the guesses and measures the errors.
	Maybe it will plot beautiful graphs.

- (maybe a) core module:
	To organize the API
